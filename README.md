> Easily add Traefik and Docker support to your roots/bedrock project. It's great! It's super easy to do! Nothing to lose (except some port conflicts!)

And it's basically non-destructive for an existing Trellis setup. Dank.

My Docker VMs now start up in less than ten seconds. They take up a fraction of the harddrive space. They use a completely negligible amount of RAM.

## Requirements

1. Docker
2. Docker-compose

## Try it out

The following assumes you are running [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) in a local environment.

Run the following commands from the `traefik` directory:

1. `docker network create traefikify`
2. `docker-compose up -d`

Run the following commands from the `example.com` directory:

1. `composer install`
2. `mv env.example .env`
3. `docker-compose up -d`

You will then need to add `example.test` to `/etc/hosts`, or however you manage your virtual hosts.

The WordPress installation screen should be available at `example.test`. Additionally, you can monitor traefik at `localhost`.

## Add to existing install

The `mixins` directory contains everything you need. You should be able to more-or-less just drop those files in and get to work, but read on:

1. Copy `./config/docker/` to your `config` directory.
2. Copy `./Dockerfile` to bedrock root.
3. Copy `./docker-compose.yml` to bedrock root.
4. Add `database` to your `.gitignore` ðŸ™€
5. Make sure the variables in the traefik-ify `env.example` are included in your existing `.env`. It should look something like this:

``` env
WP_ENV=development
DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE=example.test
WP_HOME=http://example.test
WP_SITEURL=http://example.test/wp
DB_NAME=example_test_development
DB_USER=example_test
DB_PASSWORD=example_test
```

## Party

You should be good to execute `docker-compose up` from `traefik`, then your Bedrock root. You'll notice the database mounts to a directory in Bedrock. You can change this behavior (and lots of other things) in `docker-compose.yml`.
